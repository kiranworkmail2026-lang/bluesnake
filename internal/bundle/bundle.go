// Package bundle writes a stored crawl as one self-describing, streamable file:
// gzipped JSON Lines, a header record, then the crawl-level records (the
// site-check reports and the llms.txt files), then one record per page, each
// page carrying its own text, structured data and nested link edges.
//
// It exists because the tab exports cannot carry a page. They are Screaming
// Frog-tab-shaped — flat `Dataset{Header []string, Rows [][]string}` — and
// deliberately so: they are what a human opens in a spreadsheet. A page record
// is not flat. Its headings, robots directives, schema.org types, raw JSON-LD
// blocks and link edges are all natural multiples that CSV forces into H1-1,
// H1-2, … or drops entirely, and its body text and JSON-LD have no column at
// all. Reconstructing one from the internal/links/response_codes tabs means
// joining three CSVs and still coming up short.
//
// A page record carries EVERYTHING the crawl stored about the page: every
// column of its pages row, every parsed fact, its custom search/extraction
// values, and — on request (Options.Full), when the crawl was configured to
// keep them — its raw and rendered HTML. The bundle is the one export a
// consumer should never have to go back to the store for, so an omission here
// is a bug, not a trim. Two things are deliberately NOT in the default stream:
// issues, which are verdicts (see Link) the consumer's own catalogue run can
// reproduce, and the page sources, which are opt-in because they are the
// whole file by volume — measured at 7–13× the gzipped bundle on crawls that
// kept both raw and rendered HTML — and most consumers want the text, not the
// markup.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing, and each has a test that fails if it is
// lost:
//
//   - It STREAMS. One sql.Rows scan over pages: decode a row, write a line, let
//     it go. LoadPages materialises every PageRecord including ContentText into
//     a map, which is the shape MEMORY-SCALING.md §4/Phase 2 exists to keep off
//     the finalize peak; a bundle of a multi-million-page crawl must not
//     reintroduce it. Peak RAM is one page record regardless of crawl size,
//     pinned by TestBundleRAMFlatOnPageCount. Stored HTML follows the same
//     rule: one page's file is read, written and dropped before the next, and
//     so do the crawl-level records, one row at a time.
//   - It is DETERMINISTIC. Two bundles of one unchanged crawl are byte-
//     identical: pages ordered by URL, links left in Facts.Links (document)
//     order, custom results sorted, map keys sorted by the encoder, and no
//     wall-clock value anywhere in a page record. That is what lets a consumer
//     diff two bundles and a test compare against a fixture.
//   - It is VERSIONED and COUNTED. A consumer must be able to refuse a format
//     it does not understand rather than silently misread it (the failure mode
//     of every CSV column rename), and must be able to tell a truncated
//     transfer from a small crawl. The header's `format` and its counts of
//     every line that follows — `site_checks`, `llms_txt` and `pages` — are
//     those two checks.
