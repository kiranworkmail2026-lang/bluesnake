// workPool is the crawl's scheduling core (MEMORY-SCALING.md §5.2/§5.3): a
// bounded in-RAM ready-buffer refilled by a SINGLE feeder goroutine from the
// work-queue authority, drained by N persistent workers. What it bounds is both
// the goroutine count (N workers + 1 feeder) AND the queue's memory (the
// buffer is a fixed window; the frontier itself lives in the authority).
//
// The single-producer shape is load-bearing, not incidental:
//   - workers never push, so a worker can never block on its own full buffer
//     (the WP-03 sole-producer deadlock is impossible by construction);
//   - only the feeder claims, so no item is ever handed out twice (WP-08);
//   - the feeder pulls in the authority's deterministic (depth, seq) order.
//
// in-flight = (claimed items in the feeder's hands or the buffer) + (items
// being processed). The §11 #1 termination trap is honoured one level down
// from the old push-before-done: a worker PUBLISHES its admitted discoveries
// durably (frontier.Queue.Enqueue) BEFORE done() decrements its own item, so
// when in-flight reaches zero every reachable item is already visible to the
// feeder's claim — and the feeder re-claims once more before closing.
